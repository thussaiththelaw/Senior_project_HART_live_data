The plan this semester is to have a Meshtastic radio in each of the High-Altitude Balloon boxes that we want live data from.
Description of the project:

There will be a main Meshtastic device that will have a better antenna than the other Meshtastic radios.
-It has a Heltec V3 Meshtastic variant connected to an Arduino Nano Every Microcontroller
-It's purpose is to collect the data from the other systems on the balloon and forward it to the ground receiving station

Each system we want live data needs a Meshtastic to send it's live data to the main Meshtastic.
-They will have a Meshtastic radio and will send their data using a serial connection to the Meshtastic. 
-You can't send continuous data, only text data, and I'd reccomend limiting sending a maximum of every 20 seconds to not overload anything when multiple systems will be sending.
